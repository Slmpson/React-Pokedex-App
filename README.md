# Pokedex App

A React application based on the pokedex tool used for searching pokemon.

This project uses the Pokemon API to search and bring up information on the queried pokemon.

Pokemon can be searched via a list or by using the search bar.

The up and down arrows on the D-pad cycle between two screens.

This project idea was inspired when learning about React [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ZUc7zH8BE). I decided to expand upon what was created in the video and add my own styling and further functionality.


## Future updates

Selecting a Pokemon on the list does not change the information (pokemon type) on the second screen. - to be fixed.
