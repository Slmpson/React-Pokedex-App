# Pokedex App

A React application based on the pokedex tool used for searching pokemon.

This project uses the Pokemon API to search and bring up information on the queried pokemon.

Pokemon can be searched via a list or by using the search bar.

This project idea was inspired when learning about React [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ZUc7zH8BE). I decided to expand upon what was created in the video and add my own styling and further functionality.


## Future updates

I will later be adding added functionality to the D-pad buttons to cycle through additional information on the selected pokemon.
